## Behind the Scenes: The JDD Lab’s Breakthroughs in 2023-24

The **Justice Data and Design (JDD) Lab** was established with the goal of improving *Access to Justice* for residents of British Columbia. By adopting an interdisciplinary approach that combines data science with legal expertise, the lab aims to better understand the legal challenges faced by British Columbians and the types of help they seek. Research revealed that most individuals primarily look for legal assistance through online platforms and personal networks such as family and friends. By analyzing social media content, the lab sought to identify everyday legal issues discussed online and use data-driven insights to develop practical solutions. This effort bridged gaps in traditional legal research using innovative tools, demonstrating how data science can drive impactful, real-world innovation.

## **Discovery and Ideation Phases**

The initial JDD team laid the groundwork by identifying Reddit as a key social media platform for data collection and building the foundation of the *Research Engine*. When the new cohort joined in May 2023, they faced challenges such as revitalizing existing research tools, leveraging unconventional data sources, and introducing advanced technologies to support British Columbia’s broader legal community. The *Research Engine* uses machine learning algorithms and AI to identify clusters of legal problems and sub-clusters where people consistently seek help.

The 2023-24 cohort focused on building upon this foundation by extending it with new technologies. Through brainstorming sessions and action planning, six priorities were identified:

- Restarting the Research Engine
- Building a website for the JDD Lab
- Strengthening Reddit data oversight
- Preparing monthly data updates and outreach
- Developing a new AI/LLM tool (chatbot)
- Investigating sentiment analysis using LLM

These priorities guided efforts to refine existing tools and expand their capabilities to assist individuals with their legal queries more effectively.

## **Results: Expanding Horizons with Data Science**

The JDD Lab experience not only enhanced individual technical and soft skills but also produced tangible outcomes for the broader BC legal community.

### Key Achievements:
1. **Re-development of the Research Engine**:
   - Conducted a thorough analysis of the existing web application architecture.
   - Created a structured plan for *Research Engine 2.0*, which serves as a foundational platform for ongoing research and data-driven solutions.
   - Developed methodologies for continuous data collection and preprocessing, enabling statistically significant time trends and insights.

2. **Prototyping a Legal Chatbot**:
   - Developed "RBot," an innovative chatbot leveraging Generative AI technologies.
   - RBot directs Reddit users to relevant legal information available on BC websites.
   - A scaled-down prototype of RBot, called *AC Companion*, won first prize at the *Amici Curiae Festival of Dangerous Ideas* in December 2023.
