## Behind the Scenes: The JDD Lab’s Breakthroughs in 2023-24

The Justice Data and Design (JDD) Lab, was set up with a goal to improve *“Access to Justice”* for the residents of British Columbia. To achieve this, the lab took an interdisciplinary approach, combining data science with legal expertise to better understand the legal problems which most British Columbians are having and what help they are asking for. Research showed that most people primarily seek legal help through online platforms and personal networks (family/friends). By focusing on analyzing social media content we aimed to identify everyday legal issues people discuss online and use data-driven insights to develop effective solutions to help them. The lab bridged the data gap in traditional legal research using new tools, and thus showcases how data science can be used to drive impactful and real-world innovation.

## **Discovery and Ideation Phases**

The earlier JDD team was building a proof of concept work that had identified the social media platform Reddit as a data source to begin data collection and building the foundation of the Research Engine. On joining the lab in May 2023, we faced the challenge of revitalizing existing research tools, leveraging unconventional data sources, and introducing cutting-edge technologies to support the broader legal community in British Columbia. The Research Engine uses machine learning algorithms and AI technologies to identify clusters of problem types and “sub-clusters” where people consistently seek help.

We decided to focus on building upon the foundation laid by the previous team and extending it to new technologies. As the 2023-24 JDD cohort, our journey was characterized by a series of brainstorming sessions and action planning, leading to the identification of six priorities:


1. Restarting the Research Engine
2. Building a website for the JDD lab
3. Strengthening Reddit data oversight
4. Preparing Monthly data updates and outreach
5. Developing a new AI/LLM tool (chatbot)
6. Investigating Sentiment Analysis using LLM


These focus areas helped us concentrate on refining the existing tools and expanding their capabilities to assist people with their legal queries efficiently.

## **Results - Expanding Horizons with Data Science**

The JDD Lab experience was not only essential in improving our individual technical and soft skills, but it also produced concrete outcomes that could be shared with the broader BC legal community and beyond.

One of the successful outcomes was the re-development of the Research Engine. This involved a thorough analysis of the existing web application architecture and the creation of a structured plan for its current iteration.

The goal was that Research Engine 2.0 would act as the foundation platform for ongoing research and data-driven solutions. A key component of Research Engine 2.0 analytics pipeline was data collection and preprocessing. The team developed methodologies which ensured a continuous flow of data for analysis. We achieved a breakthrough moment when we obtained enough data to generate statistically significant time trends and insights.

Another important milestone was the prototyping of a legal chatbot, named "RBot". RBot is a notable innovation, taking advantage of the growing Generative AI technologies. The goal of the chatbot is to direct Reddit users to useful and relevant legal information which already exists on the websites in BC. As a demonstration of public validation and excitement towards the lab work, a scaled-down version of this RBot prototype, called ‘AC Companion’, has secured first prize at the Amici Curiae Festival of Dangerous Ideas in December 2023.

## **Team Collaboration and Agile Practices**

Working with the Lab’s interdisciplinary team was an enriching experience for us and underscores the importance of agile methodologies, trust building, and adoption of user-centric design in driving innovative solutions. By uniting different disciplines under a shared mission, the Lab cultivated a robust ecosystem where each member contributed unique knowledge and insights. It was important that our cohort created a solid foundational environment in which subsequent teams can build and expand upon.

A cornerstone of our Lab’s success was the adoption of agile methodologies that emphasized quick stand-up meetings, weekly check-ins, and continuous, transparent communication. This provided a flexible yet structured framework which enabled us to navigate the complexities of our diverse projects. By structuring our work into sprints and quick feedback loops, the team could swiftly identify and address challenges and gaps in data. 

This approach encouraged proactive problem-solving and active collaboration between team members. The importance of open discussions and knowledge sharing cannot be overstated when working in interdisciplinary teams. Also central to our success was the foundation of trust we built within the team. By fostering an environment where each member felt empowered and respected, the lab encouraged the free flow of ideas and collective problem-solving. This trust allowed individuals to take ownership of their tasks and approach discussions in an effective manner. Leadership played an extremely crucial role in securing buy-ins from team members, through allocating sufficient resources to team building and ensuring that every voice felt heard and that team members felt confident in sharing their expertise. At the outset of our projects, we invested time in thorough orientation and expectation-setting. This initial effort was instrumental in aligning our objectives and establishing a shared vision for success. By placing the needs and experience of our end-users at the forefront, we made sure we do not lose track of the central mission in designing our analysis frameworks. This helped to ensure that the solutions were not only innovative but also highly relevant and impactful. Moreover, our commitment to partnerships and collaboration extended beyond the team. We sought out traditional partnerships as well as novel data sources. These collaborations not only broadened our insights but also reinforced our goal of enhancing access to justice through innovative data-driven solutions.
